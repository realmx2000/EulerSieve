# Euler's Sieve
This was my first real personal project and more of a way to learn my way around github than anything else. The program is an animation of an Euler's Sieve, an efficient way of finding all prime numbers up to a certain number. It works by simply stepping through numbers starting from 2 and marking off all multiples of those numbers, and repeating the process with each number that is not marked off. At the end, any number that has not been marked off is a prime. The numbers in this animation are represented with a grid of size equal to the user specified maximum, and numbers that are marked off have their corresponding square colored in. 

A demo jar is included in EulerSieve.jar.
